# Laravel Structurized Todos

## Attention. Not stable. In development.

### About

Command helps use and structurize a lot of todos with next syntax:
`TODO:[category|priority:<high|medium|low>]:<free multiline task text>:ENDTODO`

I had one long-term project and did not use any task trackers (such as Jira or Asana), as a result in the code were a
lot of unstructured todos. And I found a way to do todos structured, this format of use has justified itself.
